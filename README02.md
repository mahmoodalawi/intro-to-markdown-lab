Halloumi, a cheese that doesn’t melt, is having a moment! It's hearty and perfect for grilling, making it an excellent protein source for vegetarian meals. If you haven’t tried it yet, this is your sign to give it a go.

## Ingredients

- **4 ciabatta or whole wheat buns**  
- **1 teaspoon olive oil**  
- **8 oz package of halloumi**, thinly sliced (about 8 pieces)  
- **1 large tomato**, sliced  
- **1 tablespoon balsamic glaze or pesto** (optional, for added flavor)

## Instructions

### 1. Toast the Buns
- Brush the inside of the buns with a light coating of olive oil. For convenience, you can use spray olive oil.
- Heat a large non-stick skillet or grill pan over medium heat.
- Place the buns cut-side down on the pan and toast them for 2-3 minutes, until they are slightly golden and crispy. Remove and set aside.

### 2. Cook the Halloumi
- Place the halloumi slices in a single layer on the skillet (work in batches if needed).
- Cook the halloumi for **2 minutes** on one side until golden brown, then flip and cook for another **2 minutes** until both sides are crispy and golden. The goal is to have a nice crispy exterior with a soft, gooey interior.

### 3. Assemble the Sandwich
- On the bottom half of each bun, layer a slice of tomato, followed by **2 pieces of crispy halloumi**.
- Drizzle with **balsamic glaze** or **pesto** for a bit of extra flavor. If you’re a fan of tangy, the balsamic glaze is the perfect finishing touch.

### 4. Serve and Enjoy
- Top with the other half of the bun, and serve immediately while the halloumi is still warm and crispy.

## Tips & Notes

- **Non-stick skillet**: Using a non-stick skillet ensures the halloumi cooks evenly and doesn’t stick. While you can use a cast iron pan, it’s more prone to sticking.
- **Grilling the Halloumi**: Halloumi doesn’t melt like most cheeses. Instead, it crisps up on the outside while staying soft on the inside, which makes it perfect for grilling.
- **Bread Choices**: Ciabatta is ideal for this recipe due to its texture and slight chewiness, but you can substitute with other hearty breads like whole wheat or sourdough if preferred.
- **Customize the Toppings**: Feel free to add extra veggies like spinach, arugula, or red onion for added crunch and flavor.

## Variations

- **Vegan version**: If you’re looking for a vegan alternative, try using grilled tofu or a vegan cheese that holds up to grilling.
- **Add extras**: For more richness, try adding a few slices of avocado or a dollop of hummus to the sandwich.

## Serving Suggestions

- **Side dish ideas**: Pair your sandwich with a simple green salad, roasted veggies, or crispy fries for a fuller meal.
- **Soup pairing**: This sandwich goes wonderfully with a light tomato soup or a hearty vegetable soup.
